# Kymatic Chain Documentation

Welcome to the Kymatic Chain documentation site!

Please note that both the Kymatic Chain software and this documentation site will improve over time and is still a work-in-progress.<br/>
Be sure to engage with our community channels to stay updated.

Have fun trading and see you on chain!

## What is Kymatic Chain?

Kymatic Chain is an innovative solution to bring programmability and interoperability to Kymatic Chain. Kymatic Chain relies on a system of PoA consensus that can support short block time and lower fees. The most bonded validator candidates of staking will become validators and produce blocks. The double-sign detection and other slashing logic guarantee security, stability, and chain finality.

Please read the [FAQ](./faq/nc/general.md) to get started.


## What can I do with Kymatic Chain?

The purpose of the new blockchain and DEX is to create an alternative marketplace for issuing and exchanging digital assets in a decentralized manner.

You can:

- Send and receive KYMATIC
- Issue new tokens to digitalize assets, and use Kymatic Chain as underlying exchange/transfer
network for the assets



**For developers**, you can also:

Kymatic Chain, KYMATIC boasts smart contract functionality and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The design goal here was to leave the high throughput of Kymatic Chain intact while introducing smart contracts into its ecosystem.

Because KYMATIC is EVM-compatible, it launched with support for the rich universe of [Ethereum](https://academy.kymaticscan.online/en/articles/what-is-ethereum) tools and DApps. In theory, this makes it easy for developers to port their projects over from Ethereum. For users, it means that applications like [MetaMask](smart-chain/wallet/metamask.md) can be easily configured to work with KYMATIC. Seriously – it’s just a matter of tweaking a couple of settings. Check out Use MetaMask for Kymatic Chain to get started.

You can:

- Send and receive KYMATIC
- Explore the transaction history and blocks on the chain, via [KYMATIC SCAN](https://kymaticscan.online), API
and node RPC interfaces.

**Developers** can also:

- [Issue](./smart-chain/developer/issue-KTC20.md) new tokens to digitalize assets
- Run a [full node](./smart-chain/developer/fullnode.md) to listen to and broadcast live updates on transactions, blocks, and consensus activities
- [Develop wallets](./smart-chain/wallet/wallet_api.md) and tools to help users use Dapps

## Get Started

Want to try it **Kymatic Chain**? Just give a peek at the first few of pages of the [getting started guide](get-started.md).<br/>
You could also have a read through the [FAQ](faq/faq.md).

Want to develop on **Kymatic Chain**? First, read through the [FAQ](faq/nc/general.md) and learn about tokens [here](smart-chain/developer/KTC20.md).

## Asset Management

### KTC20 Asset

A token protocol on KYMATIC which is compatible with [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20). It extends ERC20 and contains more interfaces, such as `getOwner` and `decimals`. Read the full proposal here: <https://github.com/githubusername/githubrepo>

- [Wallet](smart-chain/wallet.md)

## KYMATIC (and Other Coins) MainNet Switch

Kymatic (KYMATIC) was an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network.<br/>
After the launch of Kymatic Chain, Kymatic (KYMATIC) is being converted into native KYMATIC tokens on the main network via the exchange platform at [kymaticscan.online](https://www.kymaticscan.online), a pragmatic and efficient way to perform the initial token swap.

Kymatic Chain is ready for other projects to migrate their tokens to take advantage of performant transactions with more liquidity options and native marketplace features.<br/>
More information about how projects can set themselves up for this (via [kymaticscan.online](https://www.kymaticscan.online) or partners) will come soon.
