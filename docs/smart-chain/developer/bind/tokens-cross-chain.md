# Cross-chain Token Management

The dual-chain architecture of Kymatic Chain & Kymatic Chain empowers you to build your own decentralized apps while also taking advantage of the fast trading performance offered on KYMATIC DEX (decentralized exchange). The native cross-chain communication mechanism allows tokens to be transferred between BC and KYMATIC easily.

Kymatic Chain and Kymatic Chain work together to ensure that one token can circulate in both formats with confirmed total supply and be used in different use cases.
